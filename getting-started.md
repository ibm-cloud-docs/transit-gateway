# Getting started with IBM Cloud Transit Gateway
{: #getting-started}
{: help}
{: support}

Use {{site.data.keyword.tg_full}} to interconnect {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructures worldwide, keeping traffic within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network. With {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}, organizations can define and control communication between resources on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network, providing dynamic scalability, high availability, and private, in-transit data between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers. Transit gateways are commonly implemented to support hybrid workloads, frequent data transfers, private workloads, or to ease administration of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment.

With {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}, you can connect:

* VPCs in the same region (local routing)
* VPCs in different regions (global routing)
* VPCs to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure
* Networks using a Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for IBM-approved solutions
* On-premise networks using Direct Link (2.0) to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} networks

To get started using {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}:

1. Review transit gateway features and use cases in [About {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-about).
2. Make sure that you have met the requirements listed in [Planning for {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-helpful-tips).
3. Create a transit gateway. See [Ordering an {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-ordering-transit-gateway) for details.
